    <h2>
        Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        What the article/code snippet does, why it's useful, the problem it solves etc.</p>
    <p>
        Visual Studio 2010 is an excellent tool, but default project template and wizards
        continue to encourage bad design practices. This article shows a better structure
        for your projects that will reduce the coupling between the different layers.</p>
    <p>
        To give the article a bit more realism, the text comes along with set of projects
        to illustrate the point. The projects demonstrate how to build a REST based service
        atop of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), how to host the service in two types
        of hosting and a sample web client application.</p>
    <p>
        Additionally to facilitate adoption of such layering a Visual Studio template is
        published at [TODO: fill-in the published location].</p>
    <h2>
        Background</h2>
    <p>
        ( Optional) Is there any background to this article that may be useful such as an
        introduction to the basic ideas presented?
        <br />
        The notion of separating software projects into layers has been around for a long
        time, but still there seems to be a lot confusion on terminology and techniques.
        Do checkout <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=software%2Barchitecture">
            available books</a> and also as short introduction into "layers vs tiers" I
        recommend to read <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905336.aspx">"Pragmatic
            Architecture: Layering" by Ted Neward.</a>

    <h2>
        Using the code</h2>
    <p>
        A brief description of how to use the article or code. The class names, the methods
        and properties, any tricks or tips.</p>
    <p>
        Blocks of code should be set as style "Formatted" like this:</p>
    <pre>
    //
    // Any source code blocks look like this
    //
    </pre>
    <p>
        Remember to set the Language of your code snippet using the Language dropdown.</p>
    <p>
        Use the "var" button to to wrap Variable or class names in &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;
        tags like <code>this</code>.</p>
